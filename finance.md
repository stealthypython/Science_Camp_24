### Introduction
Before money was created, people would trade (barter) things. For example, to get a bag of salt, perhaps a farmer could trade a goat.
There was just one problem: Transporting them! You couldn't just bring a goat all the way to, let's say, Asia just for a bag of salt, right?
In this case, Egyptians decided instead to use metals as currency. Yep, you guessed it, coin! Lydia of the Asian Empire were the creators of this currency. Nowadays, American money is called fiat (fiat means "Let it be done" in Latin).
