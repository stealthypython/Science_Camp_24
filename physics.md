## Force
- Forces are some of the fundamental concepts of physics. From gravity keeping your ground (literally) to pressure trying to push you, physics is everywhere.
- Dynamics is the study of motion that occurs because of forces-the action that happens in our Universe.
- Sir Isaac Newton was a famous physicist born in 1642. He discovered three simple laws that explain how forces can make things move. These are called the lawas of motion and they can be used to explain all physics!
- 1: An object that isn't being pushed or pulled will stay in the same state of motion it's in.
- 2: The acceleration or deceleration of an object depends on the force acting on it, or its mass.
- 3: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
- Massive Discovery: Gravity was explained by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 1600s. You can find gravity ANYWHERE-it pulls anything towards Earth's center. The bigger someone or something is, the greater the force (gravitational pull) increases.
