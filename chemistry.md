## Matter, Elements, Atoms
- Matter: Everything is made of matter. Your device, bed, and even you yourself! Nothing exists without matter.
- Elements: What is matter made of, then? The answer is elements! Different objects are made of different elements.
- Atoms: What if I got a block of iron (That's an element!) and kept cutting it until I coud not cut it anymore, that would result in an atom. You need to use special microscopes to see an atom.
- What's inside an atom: Inside an atom there is AT LEAST one neutron (these have neutral charges) electron (negative charge) and proton! (positive charge!) a neutron and proton make a nucleus, or at least not for Hydrogen. It has a nucleus made out of just a proton! Also, electrons orbit around a nucleus.
- Extra: What if I cut an atom? If you cut an atom.. It would result in a VERY BIG and I mean GIGANTIC explosion of energy. You should not and could not cut an atom!
