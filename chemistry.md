## Matter, Elements, Atoms
- Matter: Everything is made of matter. Your device, bed, and even you yourself! Nothing exists without matter.
- Elements: What is matter made of, then? The answer is elements! Different objects are made of different elements.
- Atoms: What if I got a block of iron (That's an element!) and kept cutting it until I coud not cut it anymore, that would result in an atom. You need to use special microscopes to see an atom.
- What's inside an atom: Inside an atom there is AT LEAST one neutron (these have neutral charges) electron (negative charge) and proton! (positive charge!) a neutron and proton make a nucleus, or at least not for Hydrogen. It has a nucleus made out of just a proton! Also, electrons orbit around a nucleus.
- Extra: What if I cut an atom? If you cut an atom.. It would result in a VERY BIG and I mean GIGANTIC explosion of energy. You should not and could not cut an atom!
## States of Matter
- Solids: Solids do not flow and their particles stay intact. How to tell if something is a solid: It is staying still.
- Liquids: Liquids do flow and take shape of the container they are in, such as water in a bottle.
- Gas: You know when you open a can of soda and hear that familiar hissing noise? That's gas under pressure escaping. Gas can be used to help divers breathe underwater.
- Plasma: Plasma is found in stars and lightning. It's like a gas, but some molecules have changed. They lost some of their electrons, and became ions. Plasma is the most abundant state of matter in the Universe!

## Viscosity, Cohesive Forces, and Surface Tension
- Viscosity: Viscosity is how thick a liquid is. For example, water has a low viscosity and moves freely. Tar, however, has a high viscosity and moves so slowly, you could think it's solid!
## Small Experiment: Viscosity
- Get 2 small plates or spooons and put water in one, and honey in the other. Look at how honey moves slower in the spoon than the water!
  
- Cohesive Forces: Most liquids have strong cohesive (sticky) forces, which pull the molecules together.
## Small Experiment: Cohesive Forces
- Go in your bathroom, grab some water from the sink into a plastic cup, pour it on the ceramic and see how it forms into a drop!

-  Surface Tension: The cohesive forces we just talked about (or saw, if you did the experiment!) cause surface tension. Surface tension is like a kind of skin on the water, but there's no real skin-that would be weird-just forces at work. This happens because the forces at the surface work on the water in a different way.
## Small Experiment: Surface Tension
- Go to a pond or lake and try finding pond skaters! If you can't find any, look at a video of pond skaters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2612-JHV2A
That's all! :D
